As the news of [Stephen Hawking's death](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43396008) reverberated across the internet, the [r/science community](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) on Reddit made an unusual post: [An opportunity to discuss the life of one of humanity's greatest minds](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/84aiy6/physicist_stephen_hawking_dies_aged_76/). It was the first post of its kind in a subreddit normally dedicated to talking about science papers. However, the moderator team decided his passing warranted acknowledgement given his contributions to physics and his role as the most widely recognized science communicator on the planet. He had also previously participated in [an Ask Me Anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers/) in our subreddit.

r/science was not the only subreddit paying tribute to Hawking, the entire "front page of the internet" was covered with news of his death. Comment after comment described his influence on people's lives. He was an inspiration for an entire generation of physicists and scientists. He was an inspiration for those suffering from debilitating motor neuron diseases. And he was an inspiration to everyday people who, because of his efforts, were given the opportunity to wonder about the Universe. And for a brief moment, the entire Reddit community was united in remembering his legacy.

> Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.
