As I'm sure everyone online already knows, [tragedy struck Aurora, Colorado](http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/20/us/colorado-theater-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1) early on Friday morning at a midnight showing of Christopher Nolan's final installment in the Batman franchise. Twelve people lost their lives and over fifty were treated for injuries received during the assault. My thoughts go out to the family members, friends, and residents of Aurora and Denver whose lives were devastated by this senseless violence. I threw together a quick image for use as an avatar or a Facebook Timeline cover that features the Batman symbol. Feel free to share and use them anywhere.
