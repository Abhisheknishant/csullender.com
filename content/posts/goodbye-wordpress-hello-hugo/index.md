After eight years of [using WordPress]({{< relref "hello-world" >}}), I finally decided it's time to rid myself of the [cumbersome, error-prone beast](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-WordPress-so-bad-and-are-there-any-real-alternatives) in favor of a static website. I rarely post blog entries anymore, so the convenience of the WordPress text editor and dynamic content has lost its appeal, especially since this website now primarily serves as a digital portfolio. After far too much research (i.e. perusing Reddit threads), I decided to use a static site generator to create and maintain the new website.

I already have some experience with static site generators, since my [Science GIFs archive](https://sciencegifs.csullender.com/) uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). As I was learning about the transition from WordPress, I ran across another static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that claimed to be the "world's fastest framework for building websites." Unlike Jekyll, which requires Ruby to operate, Hugo is a compiled [Go](https://golang.org/) program that only requires the download of a single binary for easy setup regardless of operating system. While build times are irrelevant for small websites such as my own, I figured it would be a good experience trying a completely new framework.
